            <p>Asheville Transit provides bus service throughout the City of Asheville and other local areas with 24 bus routes running from 6 a.m.-11:30 p.m., Monday through Saturday.

            <h3>Boarding</h3>
            <p>While waiting to board the bus, please stand at a designated &amp; signed bus stop. Asheville Transit's first priority is the safety of its passengers and cannot guarantee that riders at any location will be picked up.</p>
            <h3>Deboarding</h3>
            <p>When you get within a block of your destination (or your destination is the next stop), ring the chime to signal the driver that you wish to exit. Please stay seated until the bus comes to a complete stop, then exit through the rear doors, if possible, to help speed the loading and unloading of your fellow passengers. Ring the chime by pressing the yellow strip located between or just below the windows.<p>
            <h3>Eating / Drinking / Smoking</h3>
            <p>Smoking, eating, and drinking are strictly prohibited on all transit buses. Please extinguish cigarettes and dispose of, or store away, all food and beverages before boarding the bus.</p>
            <h3>Lost Items</h3>
            <p>Lost items which are recovered can be picked up at the Asheville Transit offices located at 360 West Haywood St., Monday through Friday, 8 a.m.-5 p.m. Inquiries about lost items may be made by calling (828) 253-5691.

            <h3>Wheel Chair Policy</h3>
            <p>All Asheville Transit buses offer wheelchair lifts and other features to accommodate riders with disabilities.</p>
            <p>By ADA standards, wheelchairs must be secured on buses. There are two wheelchair securement locations per bus, each equipped with devices which hold the wheelchairs safely in place. Operators provide securement assistance as needed. Lap/shoulder belts are recommended for safety purposes.</p>
            <p>Boarding the Bus with a Mobility Device
              <ul>
                <li>Wait by the bus stop in view of the bus operator.</li>
                <li>If needed, ask the bus operator to deploy the lift.</li>
                <li>Identify priority seating and securement areas near the front of the bus.</li>
                <li>If preferred, transfer to a seat. It is the rider's choice to transfer to a seat or remain in the mobility device.</li>
                <li>Press the signal strip to request a stop.</li>
                <li>When disembarking, the bus operator will remove the securement straps from your mobility device and deploy the lift.</li>

            </p>
            <p>Tips for Using the Lifts
              <ul>
                <li>Set the brakes on your mobility device and turn off the power.</li>
                <li>If you are standing on the lift, be sure to hold the hand rail.</li>
                <li>Lifts can hold mobility devices up to 30 inches wide and 48 inches long, weighing up to 600 pounds when occupied.</li>
                <li>A personal attendant may ride the lift with you.</li>
                <li>Backing your mobility device onto the lift may make it easier to maneuver into the securement area.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Pets on Buses</h3>
            <p>Only service animals which have been trained to assist an individual in living independently are permitted on board.  Smaller domesticated animals (cats &amp; dogs) which can be carried on in pet carrying cages and held in your lap are also allowed.</p>
            <h3>Asheville Transit Environmental Management Policy (EMS)</h3>
            <p>The Environmental Management System is a set of processes and practices that enable an organization to reduce its environmental impacts and increase its operating efficiency. The EMS is based on ISO 14001 Standards which provides a structured process for the achievement of continued improvements. These standards will allow us to document the transit operation processes, track and improve them, resulting in better performance and potential savings.</p>
            <p>The pilot project, funded by the Federal Transit Administration, includes 7 transit agencies; among them are Boston, Maryland, Miami Dade and Orlando. Virginia Tech is responsible for providing technical assistance and training needed to develop and implement the EMS. The pilot project will be developed during two years.</p>
            <p>According to the results from the previous EMS project, the benefits expected from the implementation may include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Improve environmental performance</li>
                <li>Enhance compliance</li>
                <li>Prevent pollution and conserve resources</li>
                <li>Reduce / mitigate risks</li>
                <li>Increase efficiency</li>
                <li>Reduce costs</li>
                <li>Enhance employee morale and possibly enhance recruitment of new employees</li>
                <li>Enhance image with public, regulators, lenders, investors</li>
                <li>Achieve / improve employee awareness of environmental issues and responsibilities</li>
              </ul>
            <p>This project will provide the knowledge and tools needed to face our continued growth, bringing our transit system and our city to the 21st century.</p>

Employees and students merely flash their ID when boarding the bus, and the employer/school pays one monthly bill for trips. Those trips are billed to the employer or school at a heavily discounted rate from regular fares.Employees and students no longer have to worry about fishing out passes or change for the bus, and employers pay only for transportation actually used.</p>
